# Most epic sick nasty game of all time
![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sindresorhus/pageres.svg?branch=master)

Most epic sick nasty game of all time is a 2D java fighting game developed for a computer science 219 course, that has a text-based build, as well as a GUI build.

# Language
JavaSE-9

# Usage 

**Getting Started** 

You can find the version of the code to run this awesome game on GitHub.com under the repository titled Bambam. For our final version you can look at the branch titled Final and once in Eclipse right click on the project, run as a java application, and run Main.

To pull a copy of the code, click the clone or download button on this Githubs main menu, copy the link or download the zip and voila you're on your way! 

In order to run either text based or GUI, go into the GameInterface.java class, and make IS_ASCII either true or false to suit your needs. Also, if running the GUI and you would like no sound, go into the GUI.java class and make MUTE false.

Please note that you need to click directly on "Debug" or "Start Game" on the first screen. "Debug" takes you straight to the fight screen. "Start Game" gives you a range of options as well as the controls for the game. When moving through the screens just be mindful to click directly on the image or text you would like to select. Also, jumping is only available in the GUI version of the game.

For easy mode, pick bub (the dinosaur) as the AI, for hard more pick kermit!

**Prerequisites** 

In order to run this code, you need to have Java installed on your computer. If it is not installed you can download a copy from the Oracle website
